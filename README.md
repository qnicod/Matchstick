# Matchstick

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
There is a certain number of matchstick lines.The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.The basic version must generate a game board with n matchstick lines (1 < n < 100) and have a simple inter-face so that the user could play against the computer.
The number of lines is given as parameter to the program. The second parameter of the program indicates the maximum number of matches that can be taken outeach turn (must be > 0). When matchsticks are removed, they must be removed starting from the right (like in the example below).
The user will always start the game. The program’s output (error messages included) must correspond to the examples below. Error messages which happens during a game and which are destined to the player must be displayed on the standardoutput.
In case of bad input, you must ask for the line by displaying “Line:” again, and it’s up to the player to indicateagain the line he/she wants to play on.
